            <h4 style="font-family: Futura">The How</h4>
            <p>As a very curious child growing up I constantly was asking my father about how things were made, how they were built, or in general how they worked.  
            I think I was about 6 years old when I was given a screw driver and an old telephone.  Opening it up, performing surgery on it, it was the first time I saw a circuit board - 
            thinking to myself that it looked like a miniature city - and it made me feel like some kind of explorer.  It was that feeling mixed with learning about tools and discovering ways to use them;
            the quality time spent with my father and the potential to make almost anything I found most enjoyable.  That is definitely why I continue to enjoy  
            creating and working with my hands.  (and almost starts to explain how/why I'm all over the map when it comes to the various materials that I work with - making things out of metal, leather, wood, stone, etc)
