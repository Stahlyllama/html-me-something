        <h2>WELCOME TO MY SITE!</h2>
            <p>It has been a long time coming that I am finally developing my own website/portfolio.  
            <br>So just know this is going to be a work in progress!
            <br>As many of you may know I am a Jeweler, Metalsmith, Blacksmith, and Bladesmith.  I am also a leather craftsman, amateur lapidary artist, and soon to be LaunchCode Graduate!</p> 
            <aside class="knife">
                    <p>First of all, I'd like to point out something about my Knifemaking <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> is that my last name is <strong>STAHL</strong> which is German and translated means <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/german-english/stahl">STEEL</a>.  Now if you take the similar letters in both words you get <strong>STL</strong> - which is where I currently live!</p>

    <p>&Aopf;s a very curious child growing up I constantly was asking my father about how things were made, how they were built, or in general how they worked.  
    I think I was about 6 years old when I was given a screw driver and an old telephone.  Opening it up, performing surgery on it, it was the first time I saw a circuit board - 
    thinking to myself that it looked like a miniature city - and it made me feel like some kind of explorer.  It was that feeling mixed with learning about tools and discovering ways to use them;
    the quality time spent with my father and the potential to make almost anything I found most enjoyable.  That is definitely why I continue to enjoy  
    creating and working with my hands.  (and almost starts to explain how/why I'm all over the map when it comes to the various materials that I work with - making things out of metal, leather, wood, stone, etc) 
    Please click on the links above to take a closer look at my work and to really discover more about me and my art.  Thank you!&#128074</p>.
