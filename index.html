   <p>I feel like I'm not learning as much as I should be, but having created this project assignement thus far, tells me I'm way beyond where I was before LC101 started.

    <p>&Aopf;s a very curious child growing up I constantly was asking my father about how things were made, how they were built, or in general how they worked.  
    I think I was about 6 years old when I was given a screw driver and an old telephone.  Opening it up, performing surgery on it, it was the first time I saw a circuit board - 
    thinking to myself that it looked like a miniature city - and it made me feel like some kind of explorer.  It was that feeling mixed with learning about tools and discovering ways to use them;
    the quality time spent with my father and the potential to make almost anything I found most enjoyable.  That is definitely why I continue to enjoy  
    creating and working with my hands.  (and almost starts to explain how/why I'm all over the map when it comes to the various materials that I work with - making things out of metal, leather, wood, stone, etc) 
    Please click on the links above to take a closer look at my work and to really discover more about me and my art.  Thank you!&#128074</p>.
