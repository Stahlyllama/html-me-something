    <h2 style="font-size: 30">WELCOME TO MY PAGE!</h2>
  <p>It's been a long time overdue - hopefully upon completing the LC101 program I will have time to revisit this and get it up and running!  
  <p>I feel like I'm not learning as much as I should be, but having created this project tells me I'm way beyond where I was before it started. 
    <h3 style="font-size:26pt">A LITTLE BACKGROUND...</h3>
    <p>As a very curious child growing up I constantly was asking my father about how things were made, how they were built, or in general how they worked.  
    I think I was about 6 years old when I was given a screw driver and an old telephone.  Opening it up, performing surgery on it, it was the first time I saw a circuit board - 
    thinking to myself that it looked like a miniature city - and it made me feel like some kind of explorer.  It was that feeling mixed with learning about tools and discovering ways to use them;
    the quality time spent with my father and the potential to make almost anything I found most enjoyable.  That is definitely why I continue to enjoy  
    creating and working with my hands.  (and almost starts to explain how/why I'm all over the map when it comes to the various materials that I work with - making things out of metal, leather, wood, stone, etc)</p>.
